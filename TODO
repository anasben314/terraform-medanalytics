Items to fix or workaround:

An external KV store is required for mappings
External vols can't be added dynamically and need to be specified must fix that based on /dev/sdX where X is a letter in the alphabet
Needs to be run from an account to access to r53 in red. It's possible some our our accounts don't have cross-account access.
Depending on what is to be spun up applications will likely need to store secrets, will use vault for this
It's possible to get vpc/subnets/regions/azs mixed up once you start changing things especially without access to AWS console.
Need to assess what tags we are going to keep
Create hooks to test terraform and then likely send notification somewhere or somehow. Apparatus 
Tag everything, every artifact needs tags from our terraform
Possibly much more TODO here but this is a good start.
